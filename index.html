      Dao xiao mian (shaved noodles) originated in Shanxi province in Central China. They are served in a broth with chili oil, vinegar, braised meat, greens, cilantro, and aromatics. The noodles are ubiquitous throughout China, though relatively unseen in America.

    Mei Wei is inspired by the Dao Xiao Mian of Sichuan province in the southwest. This variety is spicier, contains sichuan peppercorn, chili bean paste, in addition to the other components. Years of living in China, and recent travels in Sichuan have solidified our love of these noodles, informed us about their craft.
